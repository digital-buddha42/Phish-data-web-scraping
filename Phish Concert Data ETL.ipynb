    "# Project 2\n",
    "For project 2, we built an ETL pipeline to create a database containing data on Phish live shows from 1993-2023. First, we scrapped the website phish.net for setlists and the Wikipedia page for Phish concert tours and festivals for attendance and box office data. We then transformed the extracted data, reformatting columns, value formatting, and dropping rows that lacked useful data. We stored all of the results for each year in a variable, which were in turn each stored in a list. To load our data, we converted each variable to a DataFrame and then wrote the DataFrames to CSV files. Finally, we loaded the data from the CSV files directly to SQLite and PostgreSQL. There are many interesting questions that can be explored when analyzing the database we have prepared. For example, we could look at how City and Year affect Attendance and Attendance/Capacity. We could count the recurrence of previous Cities and weigh Attendance and Gross to create a predictive model to determine the likeliest cities to be announced for future show dates. "
